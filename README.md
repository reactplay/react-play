The `react-play` is a React project to demonstrate the well-known React patterns like,

... many more
  
I'll be creating articles ✍️ and/or videos 📹 on each of the above patterns using the code from this repository.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
