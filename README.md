## 👋 Introducing ReactPlay

<p align="center">
  <img src="src/images/og-image.png" alt="name"/>
</p>

`react-play` is an `opensource` web app that helps you learn ReactJS faster with hands-on practice model. It is a collection of `ReactJS projects` that you can use to learn ReactJS.

Is that all? Nope. You can also create your own projects and share them with the world. The best part is that the ReactJS experts will `review` your project code before it gets part of the `ReactPlay` app. Isn't that a pure WIN-WIN?
## 🔥 Demo
Here is the link to the app. We hope you enjoy it.

## 🏗️ How to Set up `ReactPlay` for Development?

You may want to set up the `react-play` repo for the following reasons:

- You want to create a new play or want to edit an exiting play as a contributor. Please check the [Create a Play Guide](./CREATE-PLAY.md) for more details. Also, please check the [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

- You want to contribute to the `react-play` repo in general. Please check the [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

Here is a quick overview of the `react-play` repo setup:

### 🍴 Fork and Clone the Repo 
First, you need to fork the `react-play` repo. You can do this by clicking the `Fork` button on the top right corner of the repo. If you are new to forking, please watch this [YouTube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8suY-Osn8Q) to get started.

Once forked, you can clone the repo by clicking the `Clone or Download` button on the top right corner of forked repo.

### ⬇️ Install Dependencies
Next, install the dependencies by running the following command in the `react-play` repo:

```bash
npm install
```
Or
  
```bash
yarn install
```
### 🦄 Start the Development Mode
Use the following command to start the app in the development mode:

```bash
npm start
```
Or
  
```bash
yarn start
```

It runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### 🧱 Build the App for Production
Use the following command to build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
Or
  
```bash
yarn build
```

It builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
