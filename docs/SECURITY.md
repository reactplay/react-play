## Reporting Security Issues

We want everyone who uses or helps with the project to tell us quickly if they find a problem that could make the project less safe. If you see something like this or think there's a problem related to safety, please do these things:

- Send an email to our team hello@reactplay.io, and tell us what the problem is in as much detail as you can.
- You can tell us on our [discord server] (https://discord.com/invite/vrTxWUP8Am).
- In the subject line of your email, make it clear that it's about security. For example, you can write something like "A Problem with Safety - Project Name."
- Explain what the safety problem is in a simple and short way. If you have any proof, like pieces of code or logs, include them in your email.
- Don't talk about the problem openly or on the internet until we've had a chance to look at it. We want to fix it before it becomes a bigger issue.
