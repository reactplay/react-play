## Implementation Details

This play implements a BMR & TDEE calculator with the following features:

- **BMR Calculation** using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (most accurate modern formula)
- **TDEE Calculation** based on 5 activity levels
- **Metric & Imperial** unit support (kg/cm and lbs/inches)
- **Weight management guidance** showing calorie targets for loss/gain
- Clean, responsive UI with smooth result animations

### Formulas Used

**Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:**
- Male: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) − 5 × age − 5
- Female: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) − 5 × age − 161

**TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier**

## Consideration

- Results are estimates and should not replace professional medical advice.
