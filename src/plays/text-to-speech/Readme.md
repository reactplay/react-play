# Text To Speech

Convert text input into spoken audio directly in the browser using the Web Speech API.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. State & Event Handling in React (or Vanilla JS)
2. Web Speech API (`speechSynthesis` and `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`)
3. Conditional Rendering & UI updates
4. Responsive layout with Flexbox and media queries

## How It Works

- User types text into the input box.
- Click **Play** to convert the text into speech.
- Click **Stop** to cancel speech playback.
- Works completely offline (runs client-side).
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- React (or Vanilla JS)
- CSS
- Web Speech API

## Notes

- Best supported in Chrome, Edge, and Safari; limited support in Firefox.
- Voices vary depending on browser and device.
- Future enhancements: control rate, pitch, and volume.
